                            I finished my Secondary Education at Notre Dame of Parang in Parang, Maguindanao. Then I took my 
                            Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science at STI College in Cotabato. I worked as a student assistant during 
                            my college days. My tasks were to assist students in different departments of the school like encoding, 
                            filing, printing, and organizing school-related documents. For 2 years of experience being a student 
                            assistant, was fun and fulfilling on my end since I was able to help my parents with their financial struggles 
                            because it reduced my tuition fee and I gained real-world experience. Right after graduation in April 2005, 
                            I tried to find my passion and ended up being an encoder in a logistic company but then I realized that I 
                            wasn’t maximizing my capabilities so I applied as a Software Developer in a Jollibee Franchise company 
                            called JTC Group of Companies this was in the year 2007 and that was the time that its open new 
                            opportunities for me and get to love what I’m doing and that’s computer programming since the job is 
                            challenging and every day I get to discover new things and learn from there on.  
                            In December 2010, I was so ecstatic to venture and explore my passion in another country as Software Programmer 
                            and I got an offer to work in a Software Developer Company in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The task is to maintain 
                            and develop a retail application that will be used to support customers in countries like Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, 
                            Sri Lanka, and India. The task was very challenging on my end since I get to interact with different nationalities 
                            and be able to support the application I handle at the same time. After my contract ended in Dubai, I worked as a 
                            Software Developer in AIA Singapore for 3 years. In August 2018, I joined in a telecommunications company as an 
                            in-house Software Developer, the same position I had with AIA. I handled the Billing and Collection System, an 
                            application that generates an invoice for customers and receives payment via cash, cheque, and GIRO.
                            At the end of August 2021, my contract was ended and I decided to return to the Philippines and plan to 
                            further my studies with new updated technologies in the market.<br><br><br><br>
